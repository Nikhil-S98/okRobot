                            <h1>What is Generative AI?</h1>
                            <p>Many articles have explained what generative AI is. In the simplest terms, generative AI is 
                                artificial intelligence used to create content (photos, music, text) in response 
                                to a user's request. Generative AI uses machine learning & deep learning models. 
                                This helps identify and pull the data needed to understand and respond to user 
                                requests. According to IBM generative AI works in three Phases (Training, Tuning, Generation). 
                                During the training phase, the AI evaluates millions of data to fill 
                                in the blanks. The training phase consumes a lot of time, energy, and 
                                money. It requires the use of thousands of graphics processing units.

                            <p>The training phase involves the use of millions of graphics processing units (GPUs) 
                                to process information. Tuning is like matching specific data to the content generation. 
                                Tuning is human labor and involves the efforts of developers to create thousands of 
                                documents to feed the AI model. The last phase is Generation. Developers examine 
                                the outputs from generative AI models and continuously tune the data to ensure 
                                that it is accurate and relevant.

                            <h1>The Past, Present, and Future of Generative AI</h1>
                            <p>The past of generative AI can be traced back to the Markov Chain, a statistical 
                                method created by Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician. The Markov Chain was 
                                designed to predict the behavior of a random process. It's mostly used 
                                in word-prediction text like autocomplete. The present of generative AI 
                                is that only 3.8 percent of businesses use AI according to the United States 
                                Census Bureau.

                            <p>The highest use of AI is in the information sector. Correct 
                                examples of successful AI programs are ChatGPT, AZURE, and IBM Watson. 
                                The future of AI is unbound and it's working its way into almost every 
                                technology that we use. From TVs to phones to laptops, there will soon 
                                be AI technology in all these devices. In 2024, Samsung released their 
                                Galaxy 24 their first smartphone with AI. Apple will be putting AI in 
                                their M4 silicon chips.
