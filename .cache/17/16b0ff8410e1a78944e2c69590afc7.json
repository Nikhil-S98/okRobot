In the simplest terms, generative AI is \n                                artificial intelligence used to create content (photos, music, text) in response \n                                to a user's request. Generative AI uses machine learning & deep learning models. \n                                This helps identify and pull the data needed to understand and respond to user \n                                requests. According to IBM generative AI works in three Phases (Training, Tuning, Generation). \n                                During the training phase, the AI evaluates millions of data to fill \n                                in the blanks. The training phase consumes a lot of time, energy, and \n                                money. It requires the use of thousands of graphics processing units.  \n                            </p>\n                            <img class=\"pageImage\" src=\"/52f0075ace61162709c05c9ace0b6b63.jpg\" alt=\"Drysdale Dyslexic Image\">\n                            <p>The training phase involves the use of millions of graphics processing units (GPUs) \n                                to process information. Tuning is like matching specific data to the content generation. \n                                Tuning is human labor and involves the efforts of developers to create thousands of \n                                documents to feed the AI model. The last phase is Generation. Developers examine \n                                the outputs from generative AI models and continuously tune the data to ensure \n                                that it is accurate and relevant.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                        <div id=\"contentAText\">\n                            <h1>The Past, Present, and Future of Generative AI</h1>\n                            <p>The past of generative AI can be traced back to the Markov Chain, a statistical \n                                method created by Andrey Markov, a Russian mathematician. The Markov Chain was \n                                designed to predict the behavior of a random process. It's mostly used \n                                in word-prediction text like autocomplete. The present of generative AI \n                                is that only 3.8 percent of businesses use AI according to the United States \n                                Census Bureau.\n                           </p>\n                           <img class=\"pageImage\" src=\"/a53103b0b758d4aab842ee72ff555c8e.jpg\" alt=\"Deus Ex Image\">\n                            <p>The highest use of AI is in the information sector. Correct \n                                examples of successful AI programs are ChatGPT, AZURE, and IBM Watson. \n                                The future of AI is unbound and it's working its way into almost every \n                                technology that we use. From TVs to phones to laptops, there will soon \n                                be AI technology in all these devices. In 2024, Samsung released their \n                                Galaxy 24 their first smartphone with AI. Apple will be putting AI in \n                                their M4 silicon chips.\n                            </p>\n\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"contentAImage\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/a9b3a49c906e0c07e878c6d6678acd4f.jpg\" alt=\"Helpful Robot from Fallout Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/a9b3a49c906e0c07e878c6d6678acd4f.jpg\" alt=\"Helpful Robot from Fallout Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/a9b3a49c906e0c07e878c6d6678acd4f.jpg\" alt=\"Helpful Robot from Fallout Image\">\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </main>\n\n        <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"a39ff0951d5b9e1942b9dd3707db5bbc","cacheData":{}}
