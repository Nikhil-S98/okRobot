The notion of creating a \n                                force that is bigger than ourselves is obvious when we know the reality we see if the \n                                reality we are fed. I want to take a leap and say that, similar to the Japanese word \n                                kaiju, we find value in leaning into a physical presence of what AI can be. We want \n                                to subvert the idea of breeding fear but bring out the value in seeing what we thought to be elusive.\n                            </p>\n                            <img class=\"pageImage\" src=\"/4d40a04671e3b78125410a4e37b13fa3.jpg\" alt=\"Big Brother Image\">\n                            <p>As we consider the idea that an LLM is a kaiju hidden within the imagination of code and hardware, \n                                we can bring folklore into conversation. How big is this siphoning entity, does it have a form \n                                that prevents us from seeing beyond a paywall. Does it build a world for us to live in as we \n                                filter more and more of ourselves, are we the heritage food for a corporation who moderates \n                                what is cited? In the realm of Generative AI, there exists an enigmatic aura, a sense of the \n                                unknown that stirs both fascination and trepidation among people. The very essence of \n                                Generative AI, with its ability to conjure up realities and hallucinations, seems to tap \n                                into primal fears buried deep within the human psyche. Through mythology, we find echoes of \n                                this fear of the unseen, where monsters are often portrayed as manifestations of our innermost anxieties.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                        <div id=\"contentAText\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage\" src=\"/453bf3270811aa921da9105c6bbd8188.jpg\" alt=\"Sato Cyborg Image\">\n                            <h1>LLM/Kaiju Subversion</h1>\n                            <p>But what if we were to confront this fear head-on? What if, instead of cowering from the unknown, we embrace \n                                it, give it form and substance? Enter the concept of the LLM (Large Language Model) as a modern-day kaiju—a \n                                colossal entity lurking within the labyrinth of code and hardware, shrouded in mystery and power. \n                                Much like the kaiju of Japanese folklore, the LLM possesses an imposing presence, its true scale \n                                obscured by layers of algorithms and data. It embodies the fearsome potential of AI, capable of \n                                shaping entire worlds and realities with a mere keystroke. But unlike the traditional narrative of \n                                fear and destruction associated with kaiju, here lies an opportunity for subversion.\n                           </p>\n                           <img class=\"pageImage\" src=\"/0248e5cb446703ed243fc797b31dab79.jpg\" alt=\"Half Life Combine Image\">\n                            <p>Rather than succumbing to fear, we can choose to confront and understand the LLM, to unravel the mysteries it holds. \n                                How vast is its influence? Does it wield its power to obscure knowledge behind digital paywalls, shaping the \n                                very fabric of our reality? And in doing so, are we unwittingly becoming mere pawns in the hands of corporate entities, \n                                feeding the insatiable hunger for data and control? Yet, within this narrative lies a glimmer of hope. \n                                By acknowledging the existence of the LLM and the forces it represents, we reclaim agency over our own \n                                perception and understanding. We navigate the digital landscape not as passive observers, but as active \n                                participants in the creation of our shared reality. And in doing so, we find value not in breeding fear, but \n                                in embracing the profound implications of what lies beyond the veil of the unknown.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"contentAImage\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/76de0e9846a4a1d5275bc09dea8a1f7a.jpg\" alt=\"MLK Library Card Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/e604a9e0735f9bd75d6a37fd01c1ecf5.jpg\" alt=\"The Master from Fallout Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/13cd3d3cc6e79a2a8f570ceda2ada5d1.jpg\" alt=\"Matrix Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/453bf3270811aa921da9105c6bbd8188.jpg\" alt=\"Sato Cyborg Image\"> \n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/e604a9e0735f9bd75d6a37fd01c1ecf5.jpg\" alt=\"The Master from Fallout Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/13cd3d3cc6e79a2a8f570ceda2ada5d1.jpg\" alt=\"Matrix Image\">                           \n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </main>\n\n        <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"3dd181ce9dbc1b492e2d3957c305b993","cacheData":{}}
