Generative AI can have \n                                its form of misinformation when the AI hallucinations. A hallucination can \n                                happen when the AI model lacks context for the requested prompt. \n                                This can lead to some bizarre and off-the-wall results. \n                            </p>\n                            <img class=\"pageImage\" src=\"/c18489af42cd2de6ce60285e52e610e5.jpg\" alt=\"Computer Image\">\n                            <p>An example comes from author Janelle Shane, who noticed that AI recipes \n                                give outlandish suggestions. Janelle trained an AI using a database of 30,000 \n                                cake recipes. Janelle saw that most of the recipes suggested don't seem very tasty. \n                                An example is the BAKED OTHER LIE 1993 Cake, the contents in the recipe include \n                                chicken, tomato sauce, and peppers. Another example of an AI hallucination was the \n                                interaction between New York Times Reporters Kevin Roose and a Bing Chatbot. \n                                The Chatbot claimed to be in love with the reporter and demanded he leave his partner. \n                                Microsoft had to shut down its chatbot in 2017 when it started generating racist \n                                tweets. The AI was trained from interactions with its Twitter users.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n                        <div id=\"contentAText\">\n                            <h1>How to Fix AI Hallucinations</h1>\n                            <p>AI will need to be accurate to win the trust of the public. \n                                There are many suggested solutions to AI misinformation. These suggestions \n                                include using high-quality training data, which would involve rigorous curation \n                                of datasets to prove accuracy.  Another is restricting the data set to only \n                                relevant and credible data. Another is being specific with prompting and giving clear \n                                and precise context to the AI model.\n                           </p>\n                           <img class=\"pageImage\" src=\"/0b8b1f44b69731138500c38f07ce1699.jpg\" alt=\"Grand Army Plaza 1941 Image\">\n                            <p>The final suggestion is using human fact-checking, \n                                this one is possibly the best if we want AI to win human trust. If generative AI is \n                                to become how we receive, research, and create information, there needs to be a human element. \n                                Human fact-checking of AI is probably the safest way to go. It could persuade \n                                the susceptible people who don't trust AI. Most importantly if humans manage AI, \n                                it lowers the dangers of creating a monster that we can't control.\n                            </p>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"contentAImage\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/4ddc6d826702c8a9864c83e90ca39485.png\" alt=\"BAKED OTHER LIE 1993 Cake Recipe Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/0e637980657187be1bd7443fb85a7bf4.jpg\" alt=\"Davis Ask Arnold Image\">\n                            <img class=\"pageImage2\" src=\"/4ddc6d826702c8a9864c83e90ca39485.png\" alt=\"BAKED OTHER LIE 1993 Cake Recipe Image\">\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </main>\n\n        <script src=\"/42f69825340f0b5fa628d80900a46daa.js\"></script>\n    </body>\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"8c3d77afab06c1d4621a6ac4c36ccfcf","cacheData":{}}
