                            <p>The mystery and hallucinations of Generative AI has led people to fear what we can not see. 
                                In mythology there has been a notion that monsters are figmentations of our mind. 
                                They highlight a deep bias fear we might have as a society. The notion of creating a 
                                force that is bigger than ourselves is obvious when we know the reality we see if the 
                                reality we are fed. I want to take a leap and say that, similar to the Japanese word 
                                kaiju, we find value in leaning into a physical presence of what AI can be. We want 
                                to subvert the idea of breeding fear but bring out the value in seeing what we thought to be elusive.
                            </p>

                            <p>As we consider the idea that an LLM is a kaiju hidden within the imagination of code and hardware, 
                                we can bring folklore into conversation. How big is this siphoning entity, does it have a form 
                                that prevents us from seeing beyond a paywall. Does it build a world for us to live in as we 
                                filter more and more of ourselves, are we the heritage food for a corporation who moderates 
                                what is cited? In the realm of Generative AI, there exists an enigmatic aura, a sense of the 
                                unknown that stirs both fascination and trepidation among people. The very essence of 
                                Generative AI, with its ability to conjure up realities and hallucinations, seems to tap 
                                into primal fears buried deep within the human psyche. Through mythology, we find echoes of 
                                this fear of the unseen, where monsters are often portrayed as manifestations of our innermost anxieties.

                            <h1>LLM/Kaiju Subversion</h1>
                            <p>But what if we were to confront this fear head-on? What if, instead of cowering from the unknown, we embrace 
                                it, give it form and substance? Enter the concept of the LLM (Large Language Model) as a modern-day kaiju—a 
                                colossal entity lurking within the labyrinth of code and hardware, shrouded in mystery and power. 
                                Much like the kaiju of Japanese folklore, the LLM possesses an imposing presence, its true scale 
                                obscured by layers of algorithms and data. It embodies the fearsome potential of AI, capable of 
                                shaping entire worlds and realities with a mere keystroke. But unlike the traditional narrative of 
                                fear and destruction associated with kaiju, here lies an opportunity for subversion.
                           </p>

                            <p>Rather than succumbing to fear, we can choose to confront and understand the LLM, to unravel the mysteries it holds. 
                                How vast is its influence? Does it wield its power to obscure knowledge behind digital paywalls, shaping the 
                                very fabric of our reality? And in doing so, are we unwittingly becoming mere pawns in the hands of corporate entities, 
                                feeding the insatiable hunger for data and control? Yet, within this narrative lies a glimmer of hope. 
                                By acknowledging the existence of the LLM and the forces it represents, we reclaim agency over our own 
                                perception and understanding. We navigate the digital landscape not as passive observers, but as active 
                                participants in the creation of our shared reality. And in doing so, we find value not in breeding fear, but 
                                in embracing the profound implications of what lies beyond the veil of the unknown.
